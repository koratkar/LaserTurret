## Based off [Michael Reeeve's Laser Turret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_P24em7Auq0) but in python

You can run laserController.py to open a basic 600x600 window which you can use to control the turret, or badironman.py, which runs an open cv thing with a webcam to track where a persons hand is in a 600x600 window, both using Michael's logic from the laser turret video. The arduino code is the exact same as from the turret video as well.   

I used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs&t=6163s) to learn some basics of the opencv module (jk i just skipped to the bit to make this, but the tutorial goes super in depth on video processing and open cv).
